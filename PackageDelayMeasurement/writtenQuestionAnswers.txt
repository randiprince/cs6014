Questions Part 1:

    What is the average queuing delay experienced by the 1000 byte packets?
        To get the avg queueing delay we must find the minimum time (which we can assume has 0 queueing delay) and
        subtract it from the rest of the values, sum them together, and divide by the number of packets
        ((11 - 2.8) + (10 - 2.8) + (2.8 - 2.8) + (3.0 - 2.8) + (5.5 - 2.8)) / 5 = 3.66 ms

    What are the reasonable estimates of transmission and propagation delays experienced by a packet of size 600 bytes
    sent through the link K?
        The transmission delay can be said to be about 2.8 ms because this is the smallest time, so it has a queueing
        delay of 0 and because we can also assume propagation delay is 0.
        The propagation delay is so small we can say it is 0. This is because we are dealing which such a small time
        in ms, that when it is divided by the speed of light, it is insanely small...basically 0.

Questions Part 2:
    2b. Suppose one of the three traceroute delay values between the source and a given router hop turns out to be
    unusually high. What are two possible causes for this unusually high delay?
        This could be caused by a packet being dropped and having to long of an RTT time, resulting in retransmission
        not happening quickly enough. It could also be due to packets being corrupt or dropped and needing to be resent
