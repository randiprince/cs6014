so we know that the return address of login is at 0x38 which is 56 decimal
we also know that the buffer starts at 0x10 which is 16 decimal
we also know that the login function takes a char[32] for the password which is 32 bytes
the password length is a 4 byte int
the fd is a 4 byte int 
32 + 4 + 4 = 40 so we need that to get our buffer overflow

if we uses the return address of the success function with a multiple of 40 rather than 10 in the python coommand we will successfully overflow/exploit the buffer 

the return instruction for the success function is: 00003e8b
so run: python3 -c  'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"a"*40 + b"\x8b\x3e\x00\x00")' > password.txt

now when we run ./a.out we login succesfully everytime
